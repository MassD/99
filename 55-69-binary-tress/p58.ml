Generate-and-test paradigm. (medium)

Apply the generate-and-test paradigm to construct all symmetric, completely balanced binary trees with a given number of nodes.

How many such trees are there with 57 nodes? Investigate about how many solutions there are for a given number of nodes? What if the number is even? Write an appropriate function.

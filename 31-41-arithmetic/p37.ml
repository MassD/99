Calculate Euler's totient function φ(m) (improved). (medium)

See problem "Calculate Euler's totient function φ(m)" for the definition of Euler's totient function. If the list of the prime factors of a number m is known in the form of the previous problem then the function phi(m) can be efficiently calculated as follows: Let [(p1, m1); (p2, m2); (p3, m3); ...] be the list of prime factors (and their multiplicities) of a given number m. Then φ(m) can be calculated with the following formula:

φ(m) = (p1 - 1) × p1^(m1 - 1) × (p2 - 1) × p2^(m2 - 1) × (p3 - 1) × p3^(m3 - 1) × ⋯
